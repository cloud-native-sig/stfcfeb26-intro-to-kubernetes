# Lesson 2: Updating the Kubechaos App
How do you update a running application without breaking it? In this lesson,
we'll explore redeployment in Kubernetes by applying changes to both the
application image and specification. 


## Step 1: Customise the Application
Open `image/app.js` and find the `suprises` variable (line 7).
This is a JavaScript array where each element is a string with HTML content:
```javascript
const surprises = [
  `<h2>🎯 Click the target!</h2>
   <div style="font-size:100px;cursor:pointer;" onclick="alert('You hit it! 🎉')">🎯</div>`,

  `<h2>😂 Joke of the moment</h2>
   <p>Why did the dolphin get a job in Kubernetes?<br>Because it already knew how to work in pods.</p>`,
   
  // ... more entries
];
```
Your tasks:

1. Locate the "KubeChaos @ RSECon26!" title and replace it with "<your-name\> @ RSECon26!"
2. Remove the original surprise elements
3. Add 2-3 of you own surprises with jokes or other HTML content


!!! warning "JavaScript Array Syntax"
    - Each element is a multi-line string wrapped in backticks \`
    - Successive elements are separated by commas


### Building the New Image
Once you've made your changes, build a new container image with a `v2` tag:
```
minikube image build -t local/kubechaos:v2 image
```
Verify your new image was created:
```
minikube image ls
```
You should see  both `local/kubechaos:v1` and 
`local/kubechaos:v2` listed.

## Step 2: Update and Redeploy
Now let's update your deployment to use the new image.
### Update the manifest
Open `deployment/manifests.yaml` and update the image tag used by the container:
```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: app
        image: local/kubechaos:v2  # Changed from v1
```
Make sure to save the file.
### Redeploy the Application:
Apply your changes to the cluster:
```
kubectl apply -f deployment/manifests.yaml
```
Check when the deployment is complete:
```
kubectl rollout status deployment kubechaos
```
!!! tip
    If we had simply modified and rebuilt the `v1` image,
    it would have been sufficient to restart the
    deployment (`kubectl rollout restart deploy kubechaos`).
    Since we changed the manifest, however, a redeployment 
    is necessary. 

### Test Your Changes
Return to the browser window/URL with the running application&mdash;on
refresh you should now see your own jokes and custom title!

!!! info
    If you closed the browser window, you can get the service
    URL from `minikube service kubechaos-svc --url` as before.

## Undoing Rollouts
By default, Kubernetes retains memory of the last 3 revisions of a deployment
If you've made a mistake, you can revert to the *previous* revision (in this case
where `image: lcoal/kubechaos:v1`) with
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment kubechaos
```
If you want to view all revisions in the history:
```
kubectl rollout history deployment kubechaos
```
You can then inspect a particular revision like
```
kubectl rollout history deployment kubechaos --revision=2
```
and further rollback to that one with
```
kubectl rollout undo deployment kubechaos --to-revision=2
```

!!! tip
    Specify a higher `revisionHistoryLimit` in the deployment manifest if you
    want to increase the number of revisions Kubernetes remembers.
